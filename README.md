Or using Bun (my preference):

### 4. Customise Your Profile

   - Duplicate `src/data/profiles/loftwah.ts` and rename it to `yourusername.ts`
   - Edit the file with your own information, links and achievements

2. **Add your images**:

   - Update the import paths in your profile file

3. **Update the index**:
   - Edit `src/data/index.ts` to import and export your profile

### 5. Local Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see your site in action.

### 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

#### Set Up GitHub Pages

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Pages"
3. Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

#### Configure Secrets (Optional)

The workflow uses a few environment variables that you can configure as repository secrets:

1. Go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
2. Add the following secrets if needed:
   - `BASE_URL`: Your site URL (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/linkarooie-3)
   - `POSTHOG_KEY`: PostHog API key (optional - for analytics)
   - `POSTHOG_HOST`: PostHog host URL (optional - for analytics)

#### Deploy!

1. Push your changes to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site
3. You can also manually trigger a deployment from the "Actions" tab using "workflow_dispatch"

#### Check Your Deployment

After the GitHub Action completes, your site will be live at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/linkarooie-3`

If you want to use a custom domain, you can configure it in the GitHub Pages settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customisation

### Changing Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change the primary and accent colors.

### Adding New Features

The codebase is pretty straightforward. Have a geez at:

- `src/components/` for UI components
- `src/layouts/` for page layouts
- `src/pages/` for the main routes
- `src/types/` for TypeScript interfaces
