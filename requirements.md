# Linkarooie Project Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

Linkarooie is a Linktree-style application that displays user profiles with links and achievements. It's built as a static site using modern web technologies and hosted on GitHub Pages.

- There should be a home page
- There should be a directory component that is displayed on the homepage
- There should be a nav bar and footer as part of a layout
- There should be a profile page for each user we have a profile for
- We should capture and display analytics for the profile pages using posthog
- I should be able to get to the analytics page for the profile from the profile page
- I should be able to get back to the profile page from the analytics page
- This might not be in the profile example but a user should be able to enable or disable being part of the directory and also having their analytics tracked/displayed
- Must have dark mode and light mode out of the box with a toggle that works

- Must be deployable to GitHub Pages
- Must work with the domain linkarooie.deanlofts.xyz
- Must be completely static (no server-side processing) [Astro]
- Must use Tailwind with only default classes (no custom css)
- Root (`/`): Landing page with directory of profiles
- `/:username`: Individual profile page (e.g., `/loftwah`)
- `/:username/analytics`: Analytics for a specific profile
- All profile data stored in TypeScript files
- No database or dynamic user creation
- A user exists if and only if there is a corresponding data file
- Updates require code changes and redeployment

### Landing Page

- Displays Linkarooie branding/logo
- Shows profile cards for users with `showInDirectory: true` that works on both mobile, desktop and when there is only one user
- Each card shows avatar, name, description, and tags
- Clicking a card navigates to the full profile

### Profile Page

- Banner image (3:1 ratio)
- Avatar image (square displayed as circle using CSS)
- Name and handle
- Description text
- Social media icons (GitHub, Twitter/X, Bluesky, LinkedIn)
- Tags displayed with distinct styling
- Links section with clickable cards
- Achievements section with clickable cards and dates
- Link to analytics page
- Hidden content visible only in browser console

### 4.3 Analytics Page

- Shows analytics for a specific profile
- Displays total page views
- Displays unique visitors
- Displays everything Posthog will allow us to
- Shows browser breakdown
- Shows geographic location breakdown
- Displays link click statistics
- Filters out bots and search engines

### 4.4 Hidden Content Feature

- Links and achievements can be marked with `hidden: true`
- Hidden items do not appear on the profile page
- Hidden items are visible only in the browser console
- Console output is styled with colors and emojis
- Hidden links are tracked in analytics when clicked

## Profile

Not 100% on the imports but this is what I would expect a profile to look like. This is the loftwah profile I want to build around.

```typescript
import { Profile } from '../../types';
import avatarImage from '../../assets/images/loftwah_avatar.jpg';
import bannerImage from '../../assets/images/loftwah_banner.jpg';

export const loftwah: Profile = {
  name: "Dean Lofts",
  username: "loftwah",

## 6. Analytics Implementation

### 6.1 PostHog Integration

- PostHog account is required
- PostHog environment variables must be configured:
  ```
  POSTHOG_KEY=your-posthog-key
  POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
  ```

This is the web snippet from the site:

```
<script>
    !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.crossOrigin="anonymous",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host.replace(".i.posthog.com","-assets.i.posthog.com")+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="init capture register register_once register_for_session unregister unregister_for_session getFeatureFlag getFeatureFlagPayload isFeatureEnabled reloadFeatureFlags updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment getEarlyAccessFeatures on onFeatureFlags onSessionId getSurveys getActiveMatchingSurveys renderSurvey canRenderSurvey identify setPersonProperties group resetGroups setPersonPropertiesForFlags resetPersonPropertiesForFlags setGroupPropertiesForFlags resetGroupPropertiesForFlags reset get_distinct_id getGroups get_session_id get_session_replay_url alias set_config startSessionRecording stopSessionRecording sessionRecordingStarted captureException loadToolbar get_property getSessionProperty createPersonProfile opt_in_capturing opt_out_capturing has_opted_in_capturing has_opted_out_capturing clear_opt_in_out_capturing debug getPageViewId captureTraceFeedback captureTraceMetric".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);
    posthog.init('phc_BrmIHTxcm8cDyDjAGkWAimepYqJhSaXiXIVDBeMOHUM', {
        api_host: 'https://us.i.posthog.com',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only', // or 'always' to create profiles for anonymous users as well
    })
</script>
```

Using posthog with astro

### 6.2 Events to Track

- Page views with timestamps
- Unique visitors
- Link clicks (regular and hidden)
- Achievement clicks (regular and hidden)

### 6.3 Properties to Capture

- Browser information
- Geographic location
- Link/achievement ID for click events
- Whether the clicked item was hidden

### 6.4 Bot Filtering

- Must implement logic to filter out bots and search engines

## 7. Visual Design Requirements

### 7.1 Profile Layout

- Banner spans full width at top
- Avatar positioned partially over banner
- Name and handle prominent below avatar
- Description text below name
- Social icons in a row
- Tags in a wrapped row with distinct styling
- Links and achievements as cards with proper spacing
- All styling implemented using default Tailwind CSS classes

### 7.2 Link and Achievement Cards

- Distinct visual styling between links and achievements
- Achievements have date display with configurable format
- Font Awesome icons included on cards
- Hover effects for interactive feedback
- Responsive designs using Tailwind's breakpoint utilities

### 7.3 Console Display for Hidden Content

- Styled console output with colors
- Emojis to distinguish links vs achievements
- Clear message indicating hidden content was found

My env example is here:

POSTHOG_KEY=your-posthog-key
POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
BASE_URL=https://linkarooie.deanlofts.xyz

## Open Graph and SEO

If it isn't already mentioned on build we will need a script that dynamically builds open graph images for the users. The main page will need open graph details too but that will be a static image I provide
